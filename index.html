                <h3>The story of Bujang Beji and Bukit Kelam</h3>
                <p>Once upon a time, lived two men named Bujang Beji and Tumenggung Marubai, who were different from each other in character. Tumenggung Marubai was a humble, kind-hearted person. Bujang Beji was his opposite. He was greedy and arrogant. They made a living as fishermen, each having his own favorite spot for fishing. Tumenggung Marubai sourced his fish from Rimpang Melawi River, where fish could be found in abundance. As for Bujang Beji, he always fished in Simpang Kapuas River, where there was less fish. Therefore, it was no wonder that Tumenggung Marubai always brought home more fish than did Bujang Beji.</p>
                <p>Tumenggung Marubai used a big trap called bubu to catch fish. After his bubu was filled with fish, he chose only the bigger ones and released the smaller ones back to the river. Thanks to his fishing wisdom, there were always plenty of fish in the river.</p>
                <p>Realizing that he had never caught as many fish as Tumenggung Marubai did, Bujang Beji felt so envious that he thought of a way to beat him. An evil thought crossed his mind. He decided to catch fish using tuba, a fish poison extracted from derris root. He found it worked. Fish were easily caught, more and more fish every day. But there was a greater problem that he did not realize, it was that the fish were greatly reduced.</p>
                <p>Based on the story, who was the greedy character?</p>
